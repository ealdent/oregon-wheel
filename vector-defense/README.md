## How to Play

1. **Placement Phase** — Before each wave, spend funds to place turrets on the terrain and upgrade existing ones. Click a turret type from the armory, then click the map to place it. Click an existing turret to upgrade it.
2. **Combat Phase** — Press **ENGAGE** to start the wave. Turrets fire automatically at enemies within range.
3. **Survive** — Protect your cities. If all cities are destroyed, it's game over.

## Turrets

| Type | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| FLAK | $800 | Dual-barrel area damage with medium range |
| SAM | $1,800 | Homing missiles with high single-target impact |
| ARTILLERY | $2,800 | Massive explosion radius |
| LASER | $4,500 | Long-range focused beam that grows stronger the longer it dwells on a target |

Turrets can be upgraded by clicking them during the placement phase. Each upgrade improves fire rate, range, and damage (cost doubles per level).
